# Arduino-Rover
This was created in my last year of High School here in Denmark(HTX) as an exam project in Technology(electronics)
It is a rover, which can travel between two GPS coordinates. It does this with the help of a ublox neo-6m gps module and a HMC5883L 3 axis magnetometer.

The implementation also consists of som ultra sonic sensors, which would help it avoid obstacles along the way.
It was controlled by a bluetooth module which was connected to a phone.
Here is a picture of the beloved rover.
